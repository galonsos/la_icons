## [1.0.0] - October, 23 2024

* Constructor update

Constructors are rebuilt so they match the `Icon`'s new parameters. However, they're of no use, since the font is not variable.

* Readme fixes

Just a little restyling and some typos fixed.

## [0.0.1] - September, 15 2024

* Initial release

Built from scratch, but heavily inspired by the `line_icons` library
